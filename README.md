# UniConnect
#### Multi-University Club Event Platform
This is a group project made for CS310.
UniConnect is a mobile application that connects student clubs and organizations from universities across the country. It allows students to discover, share, and join university club events such as workshops, seminars, and festivals through a single, user-friendly app.
The project will first focus on Sabancı University, then expand to include other universities in Turkey.
